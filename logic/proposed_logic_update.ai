  Update_ID: UPDATE-001  
  Title: Initial AI Core Integration
  Status: APPROVED
  Proposed_By: ai_core.learning_cycle
  Timestamp: 2025-07-25T16:39:27Z
  Law_Reference: LAW-001
  
Proposal_Summary:
  Integration of law.ai enforcement system with existing Ollama MCP Server to ensure
  full compliance with LAW-001 requirements including 6-step learning cycle,
  automatic snapshot generation, and pattern detection.

Current_Logic_Analysis:
  Existing_System:
    - Ollama MCP Server with tool handlers
    - Basic logging and validation
    - Test framework and linting
    - Configuration management
  
  Gaps_Identified:
    - No law.ai enforcement mechanism
    - Missing 6-step learning cycle implementation  
    - No automatic snapshot generation
    - No pattern detection for systematic deviations
    - No governance framework for logic updates

Proposed_Changes:
  1. AI_Core_Integration:
     - Add law_enforcer.js to validate all operations against LAW-001
     - Implement learning_cycle.js for mandatory 6-step processing
     - Add snapshot_mem.js for memory management and snapshot generation
     
  2. Pattern_Detection:
     - Implement pattern_detector.js for deviation analysis
     - Add automatic escalation for systematic patterns
     - Configure threshold-based pattern recognition
     
  3. Governance_Framework:
     - Establish law_control.governance for update approval
     - Implement governance.vote mechanism
     - Add audit trail and compliance tracking
     
  4. Server_Integration:
     - Modify existing server.js to trigger learning cycles on causes
     - Add automatic law enforcement to all tool operations
     - Integrate snapshot generation with existing MCP handlers

Pattern_Detection_Justification:
  Analysis shows need for:
    - Systematic deviation detection to prevent AI drift
    - Pattern-based learning optimization
    - Automatic escalation for critical deviations
    - Governance-triggered updates based on evidence

Risk_Assessment:
  Low_Risk:
    - Changes are additive to existing functionality
    - Existing tests and functionality preserved
    - Minimal modification to working code
    
  Mitigation:
    - Gradual integration with fallback mechanisms
    - Comprehensive testing of new components
    - Preserve existing API compatibility
    - Automatic rollback capability

Implementation_Plan:
  Phase_1: Core AI infrastructure (law_enforcer, learning_cycle, snapshot_mem)
  Phase_2: Pattern detection and governance framework
  Phase_3: Server integration and testing
  Phase_4: Documentation and compliance validation

Governance_Approval:
  Required_By: law_control.governance
  Approval_Method: Direct admin approval (mupoese_admin_core)
