  Version: 1.0.0
  Scope: AI Core Logic Updates
  Timestamp: 2025-07-25T16:39:27Z
  Law_Reference: LAW-001

Framework:
  Core AI logic updates REQUIRE explicit governance approval via one of:
    1. Direct approval from mupoese_admin_core
    2. Successful governance.vote with minimum 2/3 majority
    3. Emergency override only in critical system failure (logged and reviewed)

Approval_Process:
  1. Logic update proposal submitted to proposed_logic_update.ai
  2. Pattern detector validates systematic need for change
  3. Governance review initiated automatically if patterns detected
  4. Vote initiated if admin not available within 24 hours
  5. Implementation only after explicit approval

Vote_Requirements:
  - Minimum participation: 1 (for single-admin system)
  - Required majority: 100% (mupoese_admin_core is sole voting authority)
  - Review period: 24 hours minimum
  - Emergency escalation: Pattern severity >= critical

Protected_Areas:
  - law.ai file content and structure
  - 6-step learning cycle implementation
  - Snapshot generation and validation logic
  - Memory loading and pattern detection algorithms
  - Governance framework itself

Override_Conditions:
  ONLY in case of:
    - System failure preventing normal operation
    - Security breach requiring immediate response
    - Data corruption in critical AI components
  
  Override_Process:
    1. Document emergency condition
    2. Log override reason and timestamp
    3. Implement minimal necessary changes
    4. Submit full governance review within 48 hours
    5. Rollback if not approved retroactively

Audit_Trail:
  All governance actions logged to:
    - governance/governance_audit.log
    - memory/snapshots/ (automatic snapshot)
    - AI system status updates

Enforcement:
  This governance control is IMMUTABLE without following its own processes.
  Any attempt to bypass governance MUST be logged and flagged for immediate review.
  Pattern detector MUST escalate governance bypass attempts.
